# node-chat
Based on an example chat box using node.js and socket.io. Also known as k8e chat.

Requirements: node.js, npm

# Running Instructions
1. From the root directory, run:
`npm install`
2. Then run:
`node index.js`
3. Chat box should be running on **localhost:3000**

# To Do
######Node-chat is a work in progress. Here are some things I'm hoping to do.
1. Sign-in form, rather than prompt for name
2. Handling for duplicate names
3. User options
   - Get info
   - Private messaging
4. Custom responsive GUI
5. ***Integration with IRC***
